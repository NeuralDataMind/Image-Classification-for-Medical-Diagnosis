## ✨ Suggested README Structure & Content

### 1. Project Title & Tagline

**Image Classification for Medical Diagnosis**
*Classifying lung pneumonia and brain tumors using PyTorch-based CNNs and a deployable web interface*

### 2. 🎯 Overview

Explain clearly:

* The goal: automate detection of pneumonia in chest X‑rays and brain tumors using MRI images.
* Key value: high‑accuracy classification, intuitive UI via Flask app, and modular pipelines.
* Target audience: healthcare practitioners, ML students, researchers.

### 3. 🚀 Features

* Two trained CNN models: one for pneumonia, one for brain tumor detection
* Jupyter notebooks included for training & evaluation (BT.ipynb, pneumonia‑detection‑….ipynb)
* Flask-based `app.py` to deploy models via an interactive web UI
* Scripts `test.py` & `test2.py` for offline inference

### 4. 🧩 Installation

Step-by-step guide:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NeuralDataMind/Image-Classification-for-Medical-Diagnosis.git
cd Image-Classification-for-Medical-Diagnosis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Specify versions, e.g. Python ≥3.8, Torch ≥1.x, CUDA support.

### 5. 🧪 Quick Start

1. Run training notebooks (`BT.ipynb` and pneumonia notebook) to generate model weights.
2. Place the generated weight files in the root folder (same dir as `app.py`, `test.py`, etc.).
3. Launch the app:

```bash
python app.py
```

4. Visit `http://localhost:5000` to upload an image and get diagnosis.

### 6. 📋 Usage Guide

* Notebooks: how to retrain or fine‑tune models
* `test.py`, `test2.py`: how to run prediction from command line
* `app.py`: web interface workflow for end‑users

### 7. 📁 Directory Structure

Explain each folder/file:

```
/
├── BT.ipynb                          # Brain tumor training pipeline
├── pneumonia‑detection‑…ipynb       # Pneumonia detection training
├── app.py                           # Flask app for deployment
├── test.py, test2.py                # Scripts for offline inference
├── static/ templates/               # Web UI assets and HTML templates
└── weights/                         # (Optional) pretrained model files
```

### 8. 📊 Benchmark & Evaluation

If available, add classification accuracy metrics (e.g. ≥98% pneumonia detection). Otherwise note that notebooks print evaluation metrics during training (confusion matrix, ROC AUC).

### 9. 🛠 AI Workflow Details

* Dataset preprocessing: resizing, normalization, augmentation
* Model architectures: CNN design (reference your code in notebooks)
* Training configurations: epochs, batch size, optimizer, learning rate

### 10. 🔄 Export & Deployment

Highlight how trained weights integrate into the Flask app. Optionally describe how to export to TorchScript or convert for mobile.

### 11. 📚 References & Resources

Cite relevant work in medical image classification, e.g. applying ResNet or CapsNet for tumor detection ([github.com][1], [link.springer.com][2], [github.com][3], [reddit.com][4]).
Mention domain-specific frameworks like MONAI built on PyTorch ([en.wikipedia.org][5]).

### 12. 🤝 Contributing & Support

Contributing guidelines: describe issue template, pull request steps, coding style, tests. Provide contact info for collaboration.

### 13. 📄 License & Contact

Include license (e.g. MIT) and link to NeuralDataMind for questions or collaboration.

## 🧾 Style & Formatting Tips

* Use standard file `README.md` (rename from "ReadMe").
* Add Markdown badges: Python version, license, build status (if CI).
* Include a Table of Contents for easy navigation.
* Embed screenshots or GIFs of the web UI to illustrate usage.
* Add live badges or links to notebooks if hosted on Binder/Colab.

# Image Classification for Medical Diagnosis

A PyTorch-based tool to detect pneumonia and brain tumors using chest X-rays and MRI scans, complete with an interactive Flask web app for instant diagnostic feedback.

## ⚡ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NeuralDataMind/Image-Classification-for-Medical-Diagnosis.git
cd Image-Classification-for-Medical-Diagnosis
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Open `pneumonia-detection‑with‑cnn‑and‑ml‑with‑98‑acc.ipynb` or `BT.ipynb` and run training cells.
2. Copy the saved model weights into the root directory.
3. Launch the Flask app:

```bash
python app.py
```

4. Go to `http://localhost:5000`, upload an image, and see the classification result.
